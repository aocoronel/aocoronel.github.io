distro-hopping journey featuring Linux Mint, Arch Linux, Alpine Linux, NixOS, Puppy Linux, antiX, Tails, Ubuntu, Nitrux OS, openSUSE and Debian.\nIntroduction (Lore)\n\nDisclaimer: This post is highly subjective to the way I see Linux in general, and may not reflect each distro I'm going to cover in full potential.\n\nMy first OS was Windows. I've been a Windows user for about a decade, which I used mainly for basic browsing usage, gaming, chatting and sometimes to write some documents in Microsoft Word. That's what Windows had to offer me throughout the entire lifetime I was on it.\nOver my time in Windows I started to learn about optimizations, mainly because I didn't had a Buffy computer and Windows 10 was too resources intensive even in idle. Yes, from 4 GB of RAM, half was taken just to leave the system running. While 4 GB can be enough, it's generally not recommended to have such specs, specially in the ecosystem of software we have today. Everything is bloated.\nI didn't find Linux by myself though. I have a friend I've meet on-line by playing Minecraft back in 2019. We played several games together, which period was an enjoyable experience and a golden moment of gaming in my life. Time passes, and while it's still true, it's also filled with the sentiment of I wasted my time tinkering around in a virtual sandbox, that could never be anything else other than what it was. I mean, no real value extracted from it.\nThis friend of mine went to a technical school, basically a High School with a professionalizing course integrated to it. It was IT related. I remember he was learning about something called Linux. Saw a presentation of him, but didn't actually cared. Someday he invited me to try an OS called Linux Mint, and I just tried it.\n\nI remember when I boot my computer on a live system of Linux Mint, and I'm not sure what flavor of Linux Mint I've installed. I believe it had some IceWM or something similar when I did install it in 2023.\n\nMy first Linux Mint try was a mess, I had many issue, my audio wasn't working and I just didn't had any idea of what was happening. My friend suggested some commands that I had to enter in the terminal about PulseAudio, but it take no effect. Soon, I left Linux Mint and went back to Windows 10, to never return... quite not.\nMy friend still suggested me some other distros like Manjaro and I believe PopOS!, but I didn't try those, and I kept using Windows 10.\nI don't remember why I got interested in Linux Mint again, and I decided to try it by myself without my friend's assistance. This time I got it up and running, I was on Xfce and everything just worked. I did it in a dual boot with Windows, told my friend, and he was proud of me.\nI was still going back and fourth with Windows 10, mainly because of games, until the day I decided: \"Who cares about Windows games?\", and I left Windows 10, never to return. This was true, though, I still went back to Windows 10 to compare the experience, and all the times I tried Windows 10, I just simply regreted it.\nLinux Mint\nI tried all the three major flavors of Linux Mint: Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce. I love Xfce over the others, it's simple, minimal, and efficient. Though, I had no real idea what was the different from a flavor to another, still quite a normie user. I didn't know it was just a Desktop Environment (DE).\nLinux Mint was great for me at the second time, everything justed worked. At the same time I was learning about Linux, I started to learn about Cybersecurity, or at least how to improve privacy and security in an age of the digital world, which it's incredible compromised and invisible to the eyes of normal people. I learned about local-first applications, encryption, open-source software and many privacy respecting on-line service alternatives to Big Tech.\nOnce I learned about a tool called SiriKali, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with a command line (CLI) tool called gocryptfs, and I found out that SiriKali was out-dated in the repositories of Linux Mint, I got surprised. I thought Linux Mint was an out-dated distro, even Debian had SiriKali up-to-date.\n\nI did'nt know Linux Mint had control of it's own repositories, which was not the same as Debian's, even if Linux Mint is a fork of Ubuntu, which is a fork of Debian. So, it happened to me to think they were all the same.\n\nAfter running Linux Mint for about 4 months (August, 2023 to December, 2023), it started my distro-hopping journey.\nBy the way, I do strongly recommend Linux Mint to anyone transitioning from Windows to Linux. It's a very user friendly distro, which evolved a lot and don't require the extensive use of a Terminal to be configured and used. Everything is well integrated with the GUI, so no expertise is required.\nA great distro for beginners. 10/10.\nUbuntu\nI tried it in a Virtual Machine for about 10 seconds with GNOME. I don't have much to say about it, other than for a Desktop experience, it's one of the worst distros to pick.\nUbuntu is better for servers. 5/10.\nNitruxOS\nI tried this one, because I had a immutable concept, which I was interested in. This is a quite obscure distro, nobody talks about, which also happened to corrupt my USB Flash Drive. Pretty bad experience.\nNo commentary. 0/10.\nopenSUSE Tumbleweed\nPeople talk about performance in this distro and a tool called YAST. Nothing special for me. Was not a super fast distro at all. Didn't even tried it hard enough.\n7/10 I guess.\nTails\nThe amnesic system built to work with the Tor (The Onion Routing) network, specially designed for journalists and other people under extreme surveillance. Not a great distro for desktop usage, but an excellent distro to hide traffic.\nGo anonymous. 10/10.\nantiX\nThis is a very optionated distro (anti-fascist), which have impressive boot times and unbelieaveble memory footprint of 128 MB idle. It was my first distro without systemd.\nIt's also an obscure distro, which adds a layer of complexity. It have a learning curve compared to the Linux Mint experience. It's not that simple to use, but can run very well in a potato.\nThough, antiX is not a bad distro at all, it's just not for me.\nSave your old machine. 7/10.\nPuppy Linux\nAnother distro designed for potato computers, which also have a steeper learning curve. It's very different and a bit tough to get started.\nSave your old machine. 7/10.\nDebian\nWhen I reach out to try Debian, I was pondering if was going to use Debian or Arch Linux, mainly influenced by a Tier List video from Chris Titus Tech. I tried Debian first, used it for a week, and then went to Arch Linux.\nMy main point on Debian vs Arch Linux was a pointless stable vs rolling-release battle.\nDebian KDE has all the features you want, and all the features you don't want. I'm talking about 2000 packages installed by default. I has slow booting times, and most operations few slow. The machine was a 4 GB, i3 and had a HDD.\nIf you just want a stable distro, which sets everything up for you, and just start working, so Debian is great, but I'd use it only in a server. 8/10.\nArch Linux\nThis distro took me 3 tries on archinstall. It was really hard to install, even with the install script. The reason? Too many details and options. It's very easy to loose yourself and feel an angusty for selecting a bad option, like a DE or another, using Ext4 or Btrfs, and even by selecting the bootloader.\nArch Linux is easy to install, once you install it once. The unknown makes even Linux Mint hard to install.\nI started Arch Linux with KDE, which I really liked it for the design and visuals. I had to do A LOT of work to properly set everything up in Arch Linux, compared to Debian. Everything just seemed to not work properly, and require manual intervention. I managed all, and I got my desktop running properly. I riced my desktop lookings. Was pretty happy, but...\nKDE is like Windows, it takes a lot of memory in idle. I wanted something simpler. So I tried Arch Linux with Xfce, which freed some memory, but was still very resource intensive.\nI kept using Arch for a week, until I try a Window Manager called Qtile, with the configuration of DistroTube. Got it running, showed my friend, which was still in Linux Mint. I was enjoying my journey.\nQtile was very different from all the DEs I have tried, mainly because it's configured by a file written in Python. I was very uncomfortable with it, but I slowly learned how to manage it.\nI pretty much went 2024 on Arch Linux + Qtile. Firstly I had several GUI applications, still. But at November I watched a video from Cloud Native Corner from Piotr Zaniewski, which showed a Taskwarrior workflow. I found that video, because I was looking for an alternative for Todoist. I really got impressed by his system, which was PopOS!, so I decided to have a look at the terminal. Really, all the tmux, taskwarrior, neovim and fzf things made me rethink the way I was using my system.\nI watched almost all of his videos, and I replaced several GUI applications to CLI alternatives. I started to learn about Bash scripting, which I really fell in love.\n\nAfter this moment, you can find all of my work at my GitHub.\n\nI made several programs and scripts in Bash, including rofi scripts to interact with different programs, I found a tool called eureka and I rewrite it's functionality in Bash. I wrote a password manager using age to replace pass which used GPG (pretty much unusable). I made my own tmux sessionizer (idea from ThePrimeagen), also made a file organizer at the time, was written in Bash. But today I made a rewrite in C. I also made other projects like a bookmark manager with SQLite as backend to replace buku and bmm, and many other projects, all available at my GitHub.\nWhen 2024 turned over and 2025 raised, I decided to try Wayland by my next vacation at June, but I made my way to Wayland in February, by running Hyprland (mainly for the visuals).\nI put a lot of effort to rice my system, my Hyprland configuration is my ultimate WM to get productive with whatever task I need to do in the computer. Over time I started to care less about visuals, and then turned animations and rounded borders off.\nIn May I left Arch Linux for the first time, to try a very different distro called NixOS.\nArch Linux is like a home for tinkerers, and users who want to build their system the way they want. An absolute great distro. 10/10.\nNixOS\n\nI have already written my thoughts on NixOS in the previous post, which you can look if you get interested from what's coming next.\n\nI was used to reinstall Arch Linux sometimes, I made an install script, but it was not perfect. When I found out that NixOS allows me to configure everything in a file, which basically tells the system what to have installed and what to configure. I thought it was the \"Lifetime Distro\", I mean, a distro you learn how to install once, and you never have to go over the same effort ever again. Once I learned that NixOS could not manage disk partitions by default, that idea was like a sandcastle blowing up. I have a pretty customized NixOS configuration, which you can find in my GitHub and try my system just the way I used to use it.\nI used NixOS for 6 months, while my experience was roughly great, I had some issues with it, which was making me uncomfortable. Soon I went back to Arch Linux.\nNixOS is a excellent Linux Distro. If you want to try it, make sure you have enough time to learn it, and a good reason to use it. It's not a distro for everyone. 10/10.\nAlpine Linux\nAfter moving back to Arch Linux, I only had Gentoo, NixOS and Arch Linux in mind. These were the distros, which had an enormous potential. I never ran Gentoo, and I'll probably never use. The concepts of Gentoo are amazing, and I get the hype, but the practice, however, has many trade-offs.\nOnce I found out that Alpine Linux had a package manager that allows to install programs based in a file (similar to NixOS, and a program I made to have such feature in Arch Linux). Than, I also found out that it had subpackages (have only the features you want, like in Gentoo). This allows you to install only the parts of the program which are truly required and that it was a very small footprint (run in a potato like antiX). It was my time to try it.\nI have already tried installing this back when I was distro-hopping from Mint, but I never got it properly installed. However, when I tried to install Alpine Linux, it was super straightforward, simple and easy to use. Everything made sense, and the reason why Alpine Linux is used for Docker containers just clicked me. I also understood what is the glibc vs musl libc, which was always like an obscure topic, which is not.\nThis distro impressed me so bad, I had to install Alpine Linux in my phone. Absolute fantastic distro. I moved from Hyprland to dwm as well, to keep the experience as simple and minimalistic as possible.\nThis distro is just 10/10. People don't seem to talk much about Alpine Linux as a desktop distro, but it's used like fever for containers, where it really shines.\nConclusion\nOver this very short journey (about 1~2 years) I learned many valuable things about Linux and programming (the post I'll write next).\nFor anyone coming to Linux, I have some tips to guide you over this ocean of options.\nEach Distro is unique, but they are essentially the same. You can get Hyprland running in Linux Mint, Arch Linux and whatever. What changes is the package manager, the C library that everything is built with (glibc is common, but musl adds more compatibility), it's also about the kernel, package release method (rolling-release, LTS and bleeding-edge) and the features each distro provides you (target audience). Everything else is the same, the programs are the same, and the way you use the system is the same. Distro-hopping happens, because people don't know what they want, so they explore different distros to find what they want, fair enough. But in the end, just pick one and learn it.\nJust don't start with Gentoo or NixOS, everything else is acceptable. Gentoo works in a way that is not that great for the day-to-day usage, but the knowledge you get by installing it is great. You don't need to, just read the Gentoo Handbook. NixOS is for people who requires reproducibility, also it cost time to get started, and NixOS does not follow the standard FHS (File Hierarchy System) that is common in all other distros.\nSo, in the end, just pick any Linux Distro and learn it. The knowledge can be applied to all other distros, so it doesn't matter much.\nWant a desktop? Go Linux Mint (get a desktop for free) or Arch Linux (build a desktop yourself).\nWant a server? Go Ubuntu, Debian, NixOS or Alpine.\nWant to touch grass? Go Gentoo.\nMy mostly sincere opinion: If you want to use Linux as a Desktop operational system, I do highly encourage you to try Arch Linux, as a newcommer or as an experienced user.\nIf you like blog posts like this, also check this blog post by sewn, which inspired me to write this one.\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/exploring-linux-distros/","title":"Exploring Linux Distros"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/exploring-programming-languages/":{"body":"My journey on trying different programming languages as non-programmer featuring Bash, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C, C++, Rust, Zig, Odin, Go, Nim and Lua.\nIntroduction\n\nI'm not a programmer, so expect this post to be very optionated, and fun. I guess.\n\nMy very first contact with programming was when I was trying Qtile, which is configured in Python. I still don't know Python today, besides the basic syntax and features all programming languages has.\nI started to like about programming after watching a video of Cloud Native Corner about Taskwarrior, where his terminal workflow just drove me crazy. He made me rethink the way I was using my computer. Very soon, I started my bash scripting journey.\nBash\nMy real experience with creating something was in Bash. I do not consider Bash a programming language, but a scripting language. It's possible to a lot with Bash, but it cannot go way too far. Certainly, my favorite language.\nBash scripting is a glue language, just like Python, that allows you to run different programs that takes an argument and outputs something, similar to how a function works.\nEssentially you can give a shell script a name \"John Doe\", and it can do a lot of things with it, for example, output just \"Doe\" by running: echo \"John Doe\" | awk '{print $2}'.\nI made several scripts and actual programs in Bash, which you can find all of them in my GitHub. A brief collection:\n\nforg - File Organizer written in Bash, which was rewritten in C.\neureka - A idea manager program inspired by a program of the same name, written in Rust.\npass - A clone of passwordstore which uses age, instead of gpg.\nneostow - Stow, but operations are instructed by a file.\nrepox - Bulk operations with git, mainly clone, fetch, pull and push.\nmedia-converter - A simple script that figures out what you are trying to convert, with support to compression, powered by FFmpeg.\ntmux-manager - A tmux sessionizer powered by fzf, find, zoxide and tmuxp to create sessions, and a preview of each session.\nrofipass - A rofi script to interact with passwordstore and it's otp and tomb plugins.\nbmark - A bookmark manager powered by sqlite3 with support to bulk operations like editing a plain text file.\nbuild-pages - A script that uses pandoc to produce this blog.\nmirror - A way to declare what programs are installed in a Arch system, like NixOS.\njn - A journalling helper that uses fzf and rg to search notes.\ndoppel - Run commands in a different directory(ies).\n\nAll of these are available in my GitHub, some are at my dotfiles repository.\nBash can do anything, by living in the shoulders of other programming languages.\nMany can say, Bash is a weird language, or, even complex and difficult, but I find bash extremely easy compared to any other programming language, by the simple fact it's very stripped down in features.\nBesides Bash, there is POSIX compliant scripts, that have maximum compatibility with other shells, has less features, but introduce better performance.\nThis language is at my heart, but I learned to not use Bash for some tasks, when I needed more features and control.\nI've always seem programming languages like collectibles to show up in a shelf like trophies, but it's so much more than that. I have many prejudices to some languages, while admiring others.\nBash is the only language I have confidence to say it's great, because I've been using it for almost a year.\nPython\nPython is the easiest programming language, mainly because it's just a language that glue the work of other programming languages, just like Bash, but in a more integrated way.\nPython is used everywhere from backend to machine learning, it does abstract a lot, to make you more productive and ship faster.\nThere are two main flaws that Python programmers always complain about: It's a interpreted language, and it has GIL. Basically, any performance-critical task must not be done in Python, it wasn't made for that.\nPython for me is just a programming language to express your ideas and get feedback quickly by prototyping.\nBesides that, it's also the language with the biggest amount of resources for you to learn. But, even if it's put as the easiest programming language, it's very easy to fall to delusion you will get a job in one month, be realistic.\nI don't have any sort of expertise in Python, but I use it when my ideas are so simple, they don't need to be written in a \"low-level\" programming language.\nSome projects in my GitHub written in Python:\n\nsear - It's a tool to interact with Kagi Bangs, essentially a JSON file, to search directly in the search from websites, rather than a search engine like Google.\nwebshare - A simple http server to download and upload files.\nbmark-bulk - The bmark extension to make bulk operations (in bmark repository).\n\nI personally do not like Python, but it's perfect to find out very fast, that your idea was not that great.\nGo\nBasically a balance of C and Python to produce code that scales, is easy to maintain and it's fast.\nEverything about Go is good to me, except for the fact it's too easy to add external dependencies to projects, no optimizations are allowed in the binary, and the binary sizes are huge (2 MB for a hello world program). Even if go projects can end up like 60 MB of binary size, it's still extremely fast and efficient.\nThe main reason something may not be written in Go is because the GC is obligatory. You cannot take it out, thus large projects may have GC spikes. No huge server wants that.\nThe only thing I have in Go is bmark-importer which allows to import and export bookmarks from HTML to SQLite, and vice-versa.\nThe simplicity of Go just rocks, but I do not see myself writing real work in it.\nNim\nThis one is Python on steroids, really. Python syntax and C-like speed. Promises to be excellent, but my experience with Nim was very bad.\nIf you cannot live without LSPs and Tree-sitter, so this language will pose against you. Tree-sitter for Nim is the slowest I ever saw, taking more 1 second in Neovim, and 1 second in Helix to load. The nimlanguageserver just devours RAM and CPU.\nThe result of a program in Nim is just a little bit faster than Go, but it's just C with garbage collection and Python syntax.\nNim can transpile to C, C++ and JavaScript. Really, if you want to write C, C++ or JavaScript, just learn them.\nWhile Nim can look extremely appealing, there isn't a clear place where it fits better, than other known languages.\nMy only project in Nim is neostow-nim a rewrite of neostow in Nim. So good it was archived.\nOdin\nI talked about Python on steroids, this is Go on steroids. It's just feels like Go but all memory is manually managed.\nOdin feels like the right language for me, once it's fully released and has a better documentation for the core library. The reason why Odin is good, is due to its simplicity, while producing high performant code.\nOdin has a philosophy to never support package managers. I didn't underestimated that take, but once I understood the point of view from the creator, it just makes sense. Odin was my main reason to turn my back to many other programming languages like Ruby, Go, and Rust. The beauty of this language, is that it forces you to take control, not only on memory management, but the project as a whole.\nZig\nZig is simpler than Rust, but not as simple as C. It poses very hard to learn with few resources, not only to mention it's not fully released yet. It's also a good replacement to C with more safety features. The main thing about Zig is explicitness, where nothing is hidden from you.\nCompared to Odin, I feel Zig is way too much, but there isn't many languages with drop-in replacement to C, specially how on Zig does it.\nThis language has a huge potential. Can't wait to see the first release.\nLua\nQuite enjoyable to write Lua. It can be used to any tasks where you need higher abstractions while building a program with a subtle loss in performance, while not perfect though. My experience with Lua was by modifying configuration files in Neovim, which is one of the good reasons to use Lua in a project, it does immediately becomes scriptable without direct changes to the main program.\nLua is not good for standalone programs, since it's a interpreted language. It's often embedded in another language + the interpreter to allow complex extensibilities.\nJavaScript\nReigns over the web. JavaScript developers are everywhere building everything in it. Want frontend? Got it. Want backend? Got it. Want static-types? Got it (TypeScript). Want several frameworks to choose, debate and argue? Got it. Want to make games? Got it.\nI often see Brazilian developers choosing the JavaScript path, to learn Typescript, Node.js, many frameworks and say they are full-stack developers... shesh.\n\nThis take, was based on several profiles I visited on GitHub. The chances for you to find a JS engineer is very easy, specially in Brazil.\n\nI'm extremely opinionated about JavaScript. It was made for the web, and they put in the backend. JavaScript was made dynamically typed, and they made it statically-typed.\nBy the way, I love the UNIX philosophy, where programs should do one thing, and do it very well. But I take it to programming languages as well, and there is not reason why you would do everything in one language, ignoring all the trade-offs, just because it's the easiest path. You may get your work done, that's fine! However, what if the work had better results? Just my opinion here.\nHTML and CSS\nNot a programming language.\nIf it's web, you bring both. I think if you want to produce interactive and graphical applications, the web path is the easiest way to do that. Not a surprise JavaScript developers made a way to write desktop applications using JavaScript as well...\nHTML and CSS are everything about what we can preview in a browser, it can be as minimal as a CSS-less page, or as bloated to the point of getting slow to render.\nC and C++\nThe most used programming language for decades. This language is why we have other programming languages. C is the father of Bash and Python and several other languages, directly or indirectly.\nEverything is possible, coding in it is very bare-bones, manual memory management backed by Math, all sorts of undefined behavior (UB) are allowed, and if you need resources to learn C, just embrace manpages.\nFrom all of the languages I've mentioned so far, C is the language that brought me a real joy in programming. I made just one program so far in C, I have no ideas how many security holes, UBs and problems it has, but it was an amazing experience to write it whatsoever.\nC is the face of programming in a year, where many modern concepts and features were not a thing. When you reach to learn C, you get the very fundamentals of learning programming. And what you absolutely need to get a \"Hello, World\" in the standard output, or millions of lines to make a kernel which powers almost everything known to mankind related to digital devices. This allows me to talk about the next language: C++.\nC with all the modern features I told C does not have. It's fairly easy to find YouTubers pointing out that C++ is a very complicated language. That's the decision of the developer, since C++ can be written like C, with a feature or other from C++.\nFrom all the collection of C languages, the fundamentals is the same. You have full control over what you are doing, and if something goes wrong, it's your responsibility. The compiler will always take, that the developer does know what they are doing, but if you don't know... well, guess we are screwed.\nThe C status today is up-to-debate since there are always more people saying it's an unsafe language that should be deprecated.\nI do not believe that. If C was that unsafe, surely 99% of all devices we use would just explode (hacked, crash...). While that happens, it's still not a good argument alone to move billions of lines of code to a \"safer\" language, that happens to use of unsafe features to get the very same result (performance). It is the effort of taking a bolder and putting another one in the place.\nThose who write C are particularly good at writing C, while newcomers are insanely prone to commit vulnerabilities, it's a phase of programming all C developers have passed by, and does still passes. That's fine! We aren't perfect after all, but we can, sure, improve.\nI do strictly believe that learning Rust does no replace the need for learning C. Specially, because in the end you will just enjoy Rust way more if you know why it exists in the first place.\nRust\nIn my opinion, it's by far the hardest programming language you can learn today. If you follow along with the official Rust Programming Language Book, everything goes happily fine until you reach the Chapter that talks about Error Handling, Traits, and Lifetimes. Suddenly everything gets too complicated and I don't even know why I'm learning it anymore. I read the whole chapter about Traits, and understood no single word. Skill issue, mostly. I get it.\nWhile Rust does not have a memory management like in C, powered by Math, it's equally complicated.\nI have no idea why it's insanely praised among programmers (written in Rust, btw) and it's being constantly adopted as a replacement to other languages... guess I'll have to learn it by a way or another? Really?\nI like Rust, don't get me wrong, but I do not enjoy how Cargo works. Add a dependency is as easy as running a command in the terminal. Does it bring one dependency? Yes, but it does also have dependencies. So in the end you added one, and you got 20. The result? Your program was compiling in a blink, now it takes 2 minutes. Have I mentioned that developers may create APIs in the license they want? Then, you are working in a closed sourced project, and then, you accidentally got a GPL library in it...\nWe got a modern language and modern issues. Not going to Rust, I guess. Maybe I'll stick with the old and very well known UBs in C already documented over decades by experts exploring the language.\nConclusion\nSo I've onboarded all the languages I've tried and know a little bit about. Surely there are plenty of others. I'm developing CLIs, so I don't have to bother about languages like Haskell, Lisp, Erlang, Elixir, OCaml, and many others.\nChoosing a language is more about: This is the right language for the job, rather than just do it in Rust or JavaScript. It may feel very hard to pick one, and that's true. That's also another reason why I've chosen C. All the other languages offer some sort of compatibility with the C ABI, somehow, so learning C is a step to any other language.\nAfter a quite long journey, that took me some several months trying, researching, and exploring these languages, I landed on C. The only programming languages that are appealing enough to me are Zig and Odin.\nThat's my view for these languages, from the perspective of a non-programmer human with no real job at IT and no CS degree.

I'll be skipping the JSON and SQLite details, but it's useful to know that SQLite is highly more efficient in dealing with high amounts of data (that happens in the long term).\nSince the major taskwarrior upgrade, I found out that many projects associated to taskwarrior are no longer maintained and were created for the 2.x.x versions of it. For new users, taskwarrior 3.x.x is the best good to go, but for the users that were already using 2.x.x versions may have created a workflow around some tools like taskwarrior-flutter and WingTask that allowed taskwarrior to expanded to mobile devices seamlessly without sacrificing any bit of security.\nIf you never wondered about augmenting your taskwarrior setup, you may want to give at look at Taskwarrior Tools. It's a very big lists of all available taskwarrior related projects that can do all kinds of stuff.\nFor this guide, I will be focusing in two amazing tools for running a server:\n\ntaskserver for the 2.x.x series\ntaskchampion for the 3.x.x series.\n\n\nI'll not be talking about how to setup Google Cloud or AWS S3 for Takswarrior V3 in this post\n\nTaskwarrior V2\nThis will be a bare, simple, straight-forward, poor and dry redo of the already existing guide on how to setup a taskserver: Available at: taskserver-setup.\nIf you get questions on the setup, I do recommend you check the official guide, since it does give better explanations.\n\nTaskserver is only compatible with Taskwarrior 2.x, and is no longer actively developed.\n\nDependencies\n\nSetup\nInstallation\nDownload the official Github repository\n\nChange branch to master to get stable version\n\nInit submodules\n\nBuild your taskserver\n\nVerify your installation\n\nConfig\nTaskserver data relies on an environment variable: $TASKDDATA (Has two 'D's). To set this up, add the following line to your .shellrc or .env and source it.\n\nIn the Github repository you just cloned, there will be a directory called pki. Move it to $TASKDDATA.\n\nThe following command will do at lot. It will move your location to $TASKDDATA/pki and setup the certificates by running one of many scripts, and copy them to the $TASKDDATA directory.\n\nNow you will have to tell taskserver to read these certificates, by running:\n\nNext step is to setup some other configurations: Set a log and pid file, and set the address to listen to:\n\nLaunching the server is already possible using the taskdctl start command, but the configuration is not done yet. To let systemd start this automatically for you, you may set a service. This step is optional:\n\nAfter creating this file (e.g. taskd.service), you may start it as follows:\n\nIf you do not get any error, you may now enable the service running systemctl enable taskd.service.\nNow, the final part of the configuration comes. We will need to configure an organization and user and set their certificates as well. The following lines can be adjusted to your preferences.\n\nNow to setup the user certificates you will have to go back to pki directory and run the generate.client script.\n\nThe generate.client requires some of the certificates you generated on the server setup to work. In case you moved it from there, make a copy to the pki directory\n\n\nAnd finally, we have to tell taskwarrior to read these files and know where the server is located at.\n\nYou may switch host.domain to address, where it can be a public or local IP Address\n\nIf you want to run the server locally, and not inside a VM or Cloud Services, you may set a static IP Address so you configuration won't break\n\n\nChange the credentials to the one generate.client created for you. If you forgot, it's the user directory at $TASKDDATA/org/user/\n\n\nUsage\nYou must send all your tasks to the server running:\n\nThis is something you should only do once on only one device.\n\n\nThe command you will be most using is task sync for everytime you want to sync your tasks with the server. Optionally, to spare the necessity to run this every single time, you may add a crontab to run this command every 10 minutes, exemplified as follows:\n\nThat's it for Taskwarrior V2, enjoy you syncing across devices! Just remember to export the same configuration lines from your .taskrc to other devices so they will listen to the same place.\nTaskwarrior V3\nIf you read the Taskwarrior V2 setup, fear not, the V3 series is much easier to setup. The official step-by-step is available at taskchampion-sync-server\nDependencies\n\nSetup\nInstallation\nInstall rustup and set branch to stable\n\nClone the official Github repository and build taskchampion-sync-server to the release version\n\nThe binary will be created at /target/release/taskchampion-sync-server, and you may move it to any directory configured in $PATH environment variable. If you do not have a $PATH setup, you may add the next line to your .shellrc or .env and source it. It will make your ~/local/bin/ to listen to binaries allowing easier execution by the command line.\n\nYou can already run you server with the following command taskchampion-sync-server. But you may set some options to it. We will be using the --listen, -C and -d options.\n\nTo use --listen, you have to specify where the server will be available at: www.example.com, 192.168.0.5:8080 or localhost:8080\nTo use -C or --allow-client-id, you may create an UUID running the uuidgen command (mostly available at Linux systems).\nTo use -d or --data-dir, you have to point the path to where taskchampion should save the files.\n\n\nIf you already use taskwarrior, do not point -d to the existing directory, because it will wipe all your data!\n\nTo set this up, follow the example:\n\nFinally, you will have to tell taskwarrior where your server is, and how it should talk to it. So you must provide three configuration details to it.\n\nServer URL: Must include the scheme, such as 'http://' or 'https://'.\n\nExample: http://localhost:8080 or http://192.168.1.43 (for a static IP address)\n\n\nClient ID: Is the UUID you have generated previously using uuidgen\nEncryption Secret: This can be any secret string, and must match for all replicas sharing tasks. You may generate it using pwgen\n\n\nAnd of course, to ease up the process to run the server, you may configure a service to systemd. You may find the following example useful. You may set the environment variables or replace the lines.\n\nUsage\nYou must send all your tasks to the server running:\n\nThis is something you should only do once on only one device.\n\n\nThe command you will be most using is task sync for everytime you want to sync your tasks with the server. Optionally, to spare the necessity to run this every single time, you may add a crontab to run this command every 10 minutes, exemplified as follows:\n\nThat's it for Taskwarrior V3, enjoy you syncing across devices! Just remember to export the same configuration lines from your .taskrc to other devices so they will listen to the same place.\nFinals\nNo matter if you use Taskwarrior V2 and V3 you can now sync your data across different devices as you wish the official way!\nBefore I could ever knew about it, I used to use Syncthing for syncing my tasks, and they were always having merge conflicts, so I had to try something else. And running a taskwarrior server is definitively a better option.\nNote that both Taskwarrior V2 and V3 can export your data in JSON format, which means you can import your data from V2 to V3 or vice-versa, but know that doing it the other way is not officially praised, however it works fine.\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/how-to-setup-taskwarrior-server-in-2025/","title":"How To Setup Taskwarrior Server In 2025"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/i-dont-use-social-media/":{"body":"Sometimes I feel like getting into a social media platform, but I never get a decent reason to do so.\n\nName it. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Mastodon, Bluesky, TikTok or else. Which ones do you have? Why do you have them? What do you do in them?\nSomething interesting to note down, is that all of these one I've mentioned are extremely popular. Is it all greatness or it's just me not able to notice it? During my lifetime so far, I've never been inclined to any of them. To be real, I cannot say I never touched any social media platform. I actually had my Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and more, but... this was about four or more years ago. Recently to last year I tried other social media platforms such as Mastodon and Bluesky. However, I do not have any account to any of such mentioned ones, currently.\nHaving any of those, perhaps, can be great to show yourself to the world. To bring your ideas to the world. To should your work, become an influencer, to post memes or anything else that could come at your mind. Just yesterday I was visiting some profiles from relevant people to me, and I got surprised on how they use to use it. Mainly to post some random phrases, auto promotion or events. Nothing really useful at all! And I'm telling that, because at my time at Mastodon I was doing exactly the same thing.\nIn the last year, I've quit many online services altogether in a movement of reducing my footprint and necessity to control and monitor my accounts. So this means four things:\n\nI have an increased privacy online.\nI have better protection against breaches.\nI have less stuff to think about.\nI have extra free time.\n\nAnd, oh ho, what did I get by doing that? Think of having a day like this:\n\nNo need to check on one or how many social media apps a living being could have.\nDon't waste my time on shorts or TikTok.\nNo useless emails or notifications.\n\nHow many hours have been saved just in these lines? I barely used social media throughout my life, so I don't see like a great improvement (let's put it as about 20 minutes), but it may be for others.\nBut these perks comes with a trade-off. For me, the most important one is: I cannot use of such services to reach more people.\nI'm a programming hobbist and technology enthusiast. I do love to write CLI scripts and programs, and, of course, to write on this blog. Who wouldn't want to get some feedback? As I mentioned before, I was also using Mastodon for auto promotion, and it didn't made me famous, let's get real, but I surely got some extra visibility. I did that, because just making such open-source programs wasn't enough.\nI could use these high volume platforms such as Twitter to get more visibility, but what is the point? Just create an account, post random stuff and announce my new projects and blog posts? Really? Does all the cost to give my data to X, have another account, notifications or whatever else do they do with my data pays the price to get such visibility?\nThe reason why you would want to have a social media, is for the sole fact that us, human beings, require social interaction in some way. Nevertheless, it's far away from being the only way.\nI'm totally fine to keep all my thoughts isolated in a unique place where I have more control, and I choose what to display on the blog to you. But, in the end, it's my place and not someone's else, that gives such a courtesy to allow me in, and guarantee their right to banish me.\nOwn your data. Embrace control.\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/i-dont-use-social-media/","title":"I don't use social media, and why you should"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/neostow-rewrite-journey/":{"body":"I learned some interesting things while writing neostow in four different languages. Then, end up with a dilemma about which programming language to master.\nIntroduction\nIf you don't know what neostow is, let me introduce you to it, what inspired me and with I made it.\nNeostow is inspired by the GNU Stow (dotfiles manager) and is intended to serve Stow functionalities in a reversed way. You will understand why.\nAn average Stow user would use it in two different ways. The first user would enter in their dotfiles directory which has a file structure like this:\n\nSo, it's very easy to run stow -R . to symlink all of these directories and files to the parent directory or a specified one with the -t flag.\nNote the .stow-local-ignore file, which contains Perl regex to blacklist some items to not be included in such symlinks.\nThe second user would have a file structure like this instead:\n\nSo than, the user has to run stow $directory, where the directory is either alacritty, bash and so on. This is what GNU Stow calls of modules. Note, you can also use -t flag to symlink to somewhere else. And if you want to remove such symlinks, you can use the -D flag.\nI told you that Neostow is GNU Stow, but works in reverse. I mean, in Stow you have an ignore file to blacklist files and directories you don't want to symlink. In Neostow you have a .neostow file where you whitelist the files and directories you want to symlink, and optionally where they should go. By instance, this favors those who prefer the second way of using Stow, but find that Stow is a mess to use like that. I was the first Stow user type, by the way.\nEssentially, both do the same thing and can be replaced by each other, but they operate in a very different way.\nBoth support to create symlinks, overwrite symlinks, delete symlinks and show operations without applying (like a dry mode). Neostow has a few extra features. When overwriting symlinks, if the destination happens to be a file or directory, and not a symlink, Neostow will prompt you if you want to remove such and add your symlink, while providing a diff. In Stow this is prohibited, and you'd have to delete things first.\nNeostow files has a very similar syntax to an ini file, but a better ini parser still to be added to allow more interesting operations with Neostow, without external scripting.\nIn short, there isn't any magic in what Neostow is or what it does. So I can start talking about my experience about implementing Neostow in different languages.\nShell\nThe first edition of Neostow was a Bash script, but today's official Neostow Shell is POSIX compliant.\nWriting shell scripts is one of the easiest things to do, at least for me, since my first contact with scripting and programming was Bash. Getting this done, was a breeze, but the results are not very appealing.\nWhen comparing GNU Stow directly to Neostow Shell, you will notice, the later is slower. After some experiments, I realized loops in Shell are very inefficient, and I shouldn't keep writing Shell scripts for programs like this one. For every complex task that has be done in Shell, it's always a burden. Have I mentioned arrays? If you every consider use Bash to use arrays, you should find a better solution.\nPOSIX shell scripts are superior to Bash scripts. The reason is simple: simplicity is rather important than complexity. But it also, turns out that these also slow down your shell scripts.\nAfter this moment, I started to realize I was putting to much effort in doing things in Bash. I should just stop it and build stuff properly.\nThe Real Problem\nNeostow was certainly a project that took me an afternoon to make. However, for the very simple nature of reading a file and executing on top of it has some interesting drawbacks. If Neostow was ever a great thing that was used everywhere, what would be the chances for someone to write a line like this: my_library_file.so=/usr/lib/; sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /.\nWhat would this line do? It would symlink my_library_file.so to /usr/lib/ as expected, but while processing the destination path, the malicious command (that's just an example, since it could be worse) will always execute, but the nature of the ; symbol.\nI tried some solutions like realpath to expand the destination in case it had tilde or environment variables, so it could become an absolute path. The only option that worked well was eval, and that's the trouble. So, in this case /usr/lib/ does have special symbols on it, so it stays the same, but the malicious shell would execute.\nBy the way, this is an issue I happened to be aware of very lately. So I do totally discourage you to use Neostow Shell with .neostow files provided by someone else without reviewing it first.\nNim\nThe Nim version was the second edition. This was my first project using Nim, and I absolutely hated to write Nim. Maybe, it's just me, but I find Nim to be a very complicated language, with absolutely all the features possibly known built-in. I don't really get why a language would have parametric polymorphism and function overloading at the same time, but it seems the standard library adheres more to the later one.\nNim is basically Python meeting the speed of C. So you have a very bad way to handle errors with exceptions.\nLet's stop talking the bad things about it. Nim has automated documentation generation from your code comments. Interacting with C is fairly easy, has some caveats, tho. It also has static typing, to make your code more explicit, and of course, it can compile to either C or C++.\nNim seemed to be perfect to me, mainly because it had many abstractions to write programs like you would in Python, but without many worried you would get in C. So, it translates to fast development and fast runtime.\nWhere did it fall apart? Packaging. Nimble is the official Nim package manager, which is decentralized. Amazing! But when you try to add a library or install a binary using it, you may have issues, and such issues cannot be fixed by you. At least, not for me as a mere beginner to this language. I know things can improve, but I expect at least these things should just work fine. Everything else could be bad, but I should get my library or program and be happy.\nC\nThe third edition. This was my second C project at the time, and equally to the first, I have no ideas on how many vulnerabilities this program has. It has the right logic, it works like I expect to, and Valgrind doesn't show up leaks. Nice for a beginner like me.\nIt took me over a month to realize the major issues with memory related issues, which are mostly represented by strings. In C, strings are arrays of characters ended with a null-terminated character that defines the end of the string. Many functions from the standard library rely heavily on this fact. If a supposed string happens to do not have a null-terminated character, either by a bad processing or if it has never set, these functions can traverse beyond the string boundaries. This could write to somewhere where you program does not own, and then causing issues you may, or may not find out.\nSo, I was very smart, and decided to \"why not to write a string library that does not sucks?\". TLDR, it's worse. It works correctly, and has the behaviour I want, however it's about 8 times slower. I was allocating strings in the heap, always updating their memory size and length. If I was not about to modify a string, I would just use a const char * instead. When I partially finished this library, and I was slowly integrating it to my Neostow program, I realized something very important. All my strings was allocated in the stack. So I had to transition all strings to be heap allocated and it just messes everything up. I would have to basically rewrite a worse version of Neostow to supposedly be safer than the original one. How would I ultimately declare it as a beginner? Be realistic!\nI don't know what's about C, but this language bring me so much joy to write. It's just a shame that I have to keep so many variables in my head and remember some many things, having the risk to forget important things. One, being freeing memory. In the beginning it seems to be so obvious: \"Of course, when you malloc, you free. Not hard, is it?\". Oh, yeah it's simple as that when it's just a malloc and a free in a learning material. But in a real project, a free will only happen very later in the program, and you may forget that a variable was heap allocated. Not a big deal, when you can debug and inspect the memory with some tools, but the problem is that these tools are absolutely required, like opt-out. Another thing, is that there are few abstractions in C. I already found myself modifying a variable b indirectly, while modifying a directly, where b was right after a in memory, and such operation was writing out of the bounds of a.\nI love how simple C is, but I would love it even more, if it was simpler to just write things that work, without these nice caveats. That's the main reason I'm looking after Zig and Odin. I want to just enjoy programming like I did with many Bash scripts, but embrace more control. And there is no better language than C for that. It is simple and give me power, or, at least in theory where everything makes sense and is easy to follow. But in practice it just makes sense to use C, when you know by heart what each function does.\nRust\nThe fourth and last edition. Writing Rust is a thing. A terrible thing.\nI can totally sit back, tell you that this is blazingly fast, it compiles and works. Jokes aside, I actually recommend you to use Neostow Rust if you are interested in Neostow. At least this one doesn't have the same surface of vulnerabilities that C has, neither the potential to execute malicious commands like the Shell version. Kinda hot spot.\nBut really? Don't tell me the enums are unions, that a Path looks like a string, but it's not a string, or to use cargo to add libraries I don't want.\nWhat a complex language do we have here. That's fine, but do I get the same joy as C? Definitively not. I don't know why, it's just not fun. After stepping hardly on C for its pitfalls, and moving my project to Rust, because \"it's safer, it's blazingly fast, it prevents you many problems at compile time, and blah blah\".\nThe industry seems to be moving towards Rust, but do I, as a mere programming hobbist, ever need to consider learning it? I tried, and this project is a proof of that. But I don't want to write Rust, and I'll write Rust. Wait, what?\nWhile C gives me simplicity and the power to do a lot. But not only that! I'm reducing its relevance. Whenever you need to do anything more in-depth with another library (C library) or interact directly to the Kernel, C is that language that reigns it, and has first-class support for such operations. Does it matter for me? No. Whenever I need to something in C, it gotta be done from scratch. Write my own library, for everything. Do I need embedded programming? No. Do I need absolutely max performance? No. Can I even optimize something to be performant now? No. Do I want to bother setting up the build process for every library and project? Yes.\nCargo has a huge pro, and an inevitable con. It's an excellent package manager that allows you to compile your whole project without having to manually setting everything up with either GNU Make, Cmake, Meson, or Ninja. It just works. Want to install it? Run cargo install $package, and it just works. How cool would I just write my program, publish it in cargo.io, and be able to just get it and compile locally in a very easy way? That's beautiful! But Cargo happens to create a dependency monster when it comes to adding libraries from other people. That's my number one complain with it. The solution? I just don't use third party libraries. I make my own.\nClap good? Clap good. Do I wanna use it? Yes. Do I want to make my own Clap? Sure.\nThe Dilemma\nCurrently the only stable languages that makes sense to learn and use are C and Rust. I know, there are many other languages, but I do restrict myself to languages where I have control. I want to develop CLIs, TUIs, and libraries for them. I don't want to mess around with ML, web development and even worse: designing a web page, it gives me chills.\nI've already mentioned Zig and Odin, which are not stable yet, and still have a long journey to become so. But these two may be the experience I wanted from C that I didn't got. I really want to write C, but I'm not sure if I should. The same for Rust. I want to want to write Rust, but I don't feel like so. And, this place where I am, is very interesting. Only time will tell us what to expect from C in the future. Will it die? I'm sure it won't, but, it may become a legacy of projects, and the rate, which new projects uses C, may decrease.\nWho ever knows? I just wanted to learn one piece of language to master the field I want, and don't have to bother switching in the following decades. A language that is stable and here to stay. C or Rust? Here is the dilemma.\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/neostow-rewrite-journey/","title":"Neostow rewrite journey"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/nixos-review/":{"body":"Here are my thoughts on the amazing NixOS distro, which takes system configuration to another level, plus it's main principles of reproducibility and reliability.\n\nI have been using NixOS for some time now as a daily driver, so I'm here to tell my experience with it.\nI expect this post to allow you to know the benefits of NixOS, its main issues and who would benefit the most from this distro.\nFrom my whole experience of distro hoping, I've learned that each Linux distro has a purpose. There is not perfect distro for everything, but there are highly specific ones that will excel in a field. So NixOS has its own.\nTLDR\nThis is only related to NixOS. Since any Linux distro can install the nix package manager and Home Manager.\nPros:\n\nNixOS is perfect for who want to rice their desktop system and make it effortless to enable or disable parts of the config. It also allows you to have different profiles for different machines using the same config.\nIt's also powerful for servers, so updating the config will synchronize the changes among all your servers.\nDeploying a pre-configured system in multiple devices/servers. Even over SSH.\nDeclaring your system will allow you to never forget how to setup a program or a service, since it's all a file.\nIt's a immutable system. Running nixos-rebuild will regenerate all files that were changed to their original files from your config.\nBreaking your system is possible, but the solution is: Rollback to a previous generation of your system.\nYou can go stable or bleeding edge.\nCreativity is the limit.\n\nCons:\n\nYou will have to learn the Nix programming language basics. I'm not a expert in that language, but I made very far!\nRebuilding your system gets slower when your config gets large. It will have to evaluate your whole config and create a new generation from your system, even if you just added git to your environment packages.\nFinding resources to guide you to setup X program or Y service may be hard for the lack of documentation.\nDiagnose errors in your config can be very cumbersome, sometimes. It makes you almost give up.\nIt does not follow the FHS, so some things will not work out of the box, because they rely on that. You will have to adapt your scripts to run in NixOS by using env.\nYou can declare a lot of settings, but not everything. A good example is the lack of declarative partitioning, which is addressed by disko.\nExpect to have a large disk usage.\nNixOS is a time investment. This is a fact.\n\nMy thoughts on NixOS\nI initially used NixOS, because I had the idea of \"The Lifetime Distro\". By that I mean: I no longer will have to know all the steps to setup my system the way it is, therefore no chance to forget about setting up a program or service. So, all my changes to the config would never degrade overtime, for example: I reinstalled my distro and I forgot to enable my firewall with that particular config. This is a real problem when you use several tools. No way I can remember the whole setup process after a year. For four months of using NixOS I definitively can tell its a amazing distro. But I didn't knew I was about to change my thoughts on it. As I already mentioned, each distro has its perks for each field. And my goals changed to be more inclined to Arch Linux, because NixOS was becoming too overkill to me. The reason? Well:\nSome of the issues I pointed in the TLDR section is the full config evaluation to just install git. NixOS does a great job, but in my view it is not efficient. It will be surely faster, than a full system upgrade, but it's still slower than using another package manager. Someone could point out to use the nix-env command, but I use NixOS the nix way.\nIf you ever got curious how long I took to make my NixOS config good enough to use it as daily driver, well it took me a whole week to replicate my previous setup from my Arch Linux install. You can look my config in here: aocoronel/nix. I definitively took my way up until here to turn back to NixOS... at least it helped me build a modular and well structured repository. It does not have a guideline file to explain how I organize the files, but you can guess it by reading it. At least I think so.\nMy thoughts on Home Manager\nWell, I used Home Manager just because I wanted to try it. It makes part of my config, but there is no truly reason to that to be there. Home Manager is a user based nix-like configuration without relying on root privileges. It allows you to install and configure programs and manage your $HOME directory from a single or modular config. I get the point of Home Manager, but it is a struggle to setup, just like NixOS. I use stow to manage my dotfiles, btw. Doing so I have an agnostic config without relying on Home Manager. For the user programs, just adding them to my NixOS config would be enough, and then Home Manager is useless to me.\nMy thoughts on the Nix Package Manager\nThis is surely one of the coolest package managers I ever used. I can try any software without really installing it in my system, create development shells to end the dependency hell, and it also allows developers to ship flakes so the users that have the nix package manager can install their programs without headaches of thinking about dependencies. Everything just works. NixOS empowers the nix package manager experience by allowing you to configure what programs are installed, something that you can only have in other distros, if you have Home Manager. Not even the software themselves suffer from dependency hell, when a X program need Y dependency at this version and W program needs Y at that other version. This package manager may not be beneficial for everyone, but it's a must for every developer that program using languages like Python and C, since imports are got from installing programs in the system. So create a shell.nix with all dependencies will allow your Python code to run and your C code to compile.\nConclusion\nNixOS is not a bad distro, it's pretty good, actually, but it can be overwhelming if you are not ready to put your time into it, since there is a lot to do, to make it a daily driver, at least for a desktop experience.\nIf the idea of reproducibility, declarative and reliability resonates with you and you want to try NixOS, you can check on someone's else configuration to get started with, it helps a lot.\nI greatly recommend you to give a look at Emmet's (LibrePhoenix) configuration at librephoenix/nixos-config. I totally took a lot of inspiration from him in my NixOS journey. Really appreciate!\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/nixos-review/","title":"NixOS - Usage Review"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/regain-control-over-what-you-watch-in-youtube/":{"body":"Make yourself a step from being lured by useless recommendations in YouTube with Invidious\n\n\nThe instructions to install Invidious in this post are no longer supported by Invidious. Check on the official documentation.\n\nIntroduction\nIn this post I'll show how to self-host Invidious with Docker, and configure FreeTube to use your Invidious Instance for best performance, enjoy ad-free videos and regain control over what you watch. While self-hosting Invidious is not mandatory, it allows you to watch YouTube videos without relying on the YouTube API to improve your privacy, and it does also give you some unique perks like accounts (but I'll not cover this).\nYouTube is inevitable. If you want to watch anything, is it a cook recipe guide, hear some music, learn how to do something, get entertained or anything else you may think, you may find yourself in YouTube. But there is a catch. YouTube has over TOO MUCH features, and mostly of them do not make everyone very happy, and some of them may put you in a vicious loop, seeking for cheap dopamine.\nI used to use YouTube like any other regular person, until I stepped to the world of the privacy concerned, and I found a YouTube Frontend called CloudTube or Cadence, and in the very homepage, that was very clean, without a single recommendation, trends or anything else, other was a link called: ...can't think of anything?. This link let me to a page with some kind of story and an audio. In few words, what those words meant was, that you may find yourself getting to YouTube with no goal, and wait for something wonderful to happen, just like finding an amazing video that may change your life, when there was no reason to you be there in the first place.\nSince I read that post, I've started to get more aware of what I was consuming online, not only for YouTube. And so I wanted to keep all the content I consume aligned to what was my purpose, what I actually wanted to learn, and what I wanted to do.\nThen, I found an amazing application called FreeTube. This was a much better way to watch YouTube videos in an interface that was highly customizable, and the options to disable some content from showing up such as Trending, Popular Videos and Shorts. And them that was my choice. I completely shredded my YouTube data and moved to FreeTube ways of dealing with history, playlist and subscriptions.\nFreeTube has the option to use an Invidious Instance as its backend, which does not rely on the youtube.js to work, and strip the ads itself. But Invidious providers doesn't offer very highly performance compared to FreeTube itself. That was when I tried to self-host Invidious.\nSetup\nDependencies\n\ndocker and docker-compose, or podman and podman-compose\ngit\nopenssl (optional)\n\n\nI do use podman for containerization, and all my scripts shown in this post also use podman. You may tweak them if you want to use docker instead\n\nInstallation\nThe official documentation may be found at Invidious/Installation\nFirst you will need to clone the official Invidious repository to get all the necessary files for Invidious to work.\n\nIf you try to run docker-compose just after cloning the Invidious repository, you will use the development configuration, and not the production configuration\n\n\nThere is only one file you must change in this repository: docker-compose.yml\nYou should replace the docker-compose.yml in the Invidious repository with the following:\n\nBut it's not over yet. We need to change a few things in this configuration, such as the visitor_data, po_token and the hmac_key.\nTo better explain what are the visitor_data and po_token, they allow to bypass verification checks from YouTube, however as it is an unique identifier, it may be used as a fingerprinting technique to trace you. To work around this the values may be changed from time to time. While there is no official tool to do this, you may use a shell script I've developed to ensure you harden your privacy, which I'll show in Usage section.\nDo get these values manually you will need to run another docker:\n\nAt the end of the executing, it will return the visitor_data and po_token you will need to add to your docker-compose.yml file.\nThe script I've made automatically runs this docker, gets these values and overwrite the current ones in the docker.compose.yml file. The script is shown down below:\n\nYou may change the invidious_config path to your actual invidious directory.\n\n\nThe last thing we need to do is to create an hmac_key, which it can be any value created by the user. To easily create a hmac_key you can run the following command\n\nNow that you installed Invidious, you will have to configure FreeTube to listen to you server. It's as easy as to go to the Settings &gt; General &gt; Current Invidious Instance. In the box you will insert the address for the Invidious Instance. If you have not made any changes to the address in the docker-compose.yml file, it'll be http://localhost:3000 by default.\nThat's it!\nUsage\nNow that you got Invidious as you backend, and using FreeTube as your frontend. You can now explore all YouTube videos without any kind of ads, and in a very customizable environment.\nI've made a script (shown down below) that I always use to open my FreeTube application. It will start the container if it's not running already, but if it does I'll skip the boot and will launch the FreeTube application. Note that the script sleeps for 5 seconds when a container is started before it launches the FreeTube application. This is to give time to the container to be fully operational, else the application will fail to use the self-hosted Invidious instance and will fall back to the FreeTube's API.\nIt does also ensure your tokens are refreshed once per session. The official documentation mention some sort of \"change every X hours\". But I noticed that generating tokens often may produce broken tokens that may not work as expected, that's why I kept it once per session. The script can be found here:\n\nConclusion\nWhy did I do all this hard work just to watch YouTube videos? That's just because Invidious offer more stability rather than FreeTube API, but FreeTube interface is completely superior to Invidious Web Interface, which you can customize it the way you want, is it colors or what sections are visible while navigating through the videos.\nI'd say that this is a very cozy way, yet technical to setup FreeTube. While self-hosting Invidious is not a must, you may use the FreeTube API without any problems, but notice that it may come with some issues from time to time.\nFreeTube is my solution to watch the videos I want to watch rather than what is recommended to me to watch based on algorithms. This save me uncountable amounts of hours from time wasting on videos I wasn't meant to be watching, and keeping the overall experience much more stress-free, by bypassing all ads.\nNot only that, but I can have all my data saved locally and exported across different services and clients at any time.\nFor a last thing, almost off-topic. You can both save your audios or videos from FreeTube or Invidious Web Interface at high-speeds if you self-host an Invidious Instance. But if you want to download videos or audios in a more scriptable way, you may find some of my other scripts interesting, such as: download-youtube.sh and download-freetube.sh. The first one allows you to download any YouTube audio or video from a URL, and even in bulk. The second one allows you to download your FreeTube's Playlists exported to a .db format, but it depends on the first one to work.\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/regain-control-over-what-you-watch-in-youtube/","title":"Regain Control Over What You Watch in YouTube"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/the-only-all-in-one-tool-you-will-ever-need/":{"body":"There are many A-I-O available out there, but what if you could use only one ultimate A-I-O tool?\n\nThese type of tools are focused in several features to reduce your needs to have one app for each task. For example, if you use more than one messaging app, like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, and Discord, what would it look like to use one app a have access to all chats in these platforms? That's what A-I-O tools do, but not limited only for that.\nHowever, these tools are always presented with an interface that is often visually pleasing and managed by your mouse, if not cluttered as well. What the true A-I-O solution actually looks like is not similar to that. It should be a single familiar environment that's able to solve any kind of problem. For that it should be extensible without affecting performance, and highly customizable to user liking.\nOkay, let's end this suspense. The A-I-O tool I'm talking about is the Terminal Emulator. Surprised? The terminal is the first shape of what computers look liked a while ago, in the name of \"console\". These machines only had a screen and a keyboard, so the main development focus is to increase usability with the keyboard. In short, a Terminal Emulator is actually a graphical interface that emulates those consoles to allow you to access the true star: The shell.\nThe reason why the Terminal Emulator is an A-I-O tool is because it allows you to use the shell, whatever is it bash (Bourne Again Shell), zsh, fish, nushell or others. And then, you can run many other tools.\nThe Terminal Emulator and its keyboard-centric experience is the easiest path to solve complex problem. Some tools are so effective, we could tell they allow the machine to read the mind of the user, like vim. Vim is a quite simple text editor, with the \"least keystrokes\" philosophy, which means that complex text tasks should be completed with only a few keystrokes. Much more enjoyable to do so, rather than searching for options in a screen full of options to click with the mouse. I mean, there is no friction to stop you.\nThe amount of available tools for different problem solving are infinite, and if it doesn't exist, you can create it yourself with some programming skills. Some examples are task management, text editing, file management, multimedia conversion and compression, password management and so much more.\nThe available tools you have to use in a Terminal Emulator depends only on the user. The users chooses which tools they want installed in their systems, which is not so hard to do so. It can be easily accomplished using package managers like apt, pacman, rpm (Linux) and brew (MacOS).\nIsn't that amazing? Do all possible tasks in the very same environment. The best part of it, is that you only have to learn how to use a tool once, and it will hardly have a breaking changing in how it works and should be used.\nSome other great advantages of using a Terminal Emulator is that the user have higher control and power over their system. They can use multiple programs together to create even more powerful outputs. And just by using it, you unlock the shell scripting recipe, which is a way to create some automation, but in a way that if you are already familiar with the terminal, it's a breeze to do so. Follow a very simple example:\n\nThis very simple script creates a backup folder, moves all files and directories (folders) to the backup directory and than it uses the tar (archiving tool) to archive and compress the backup directory as backup.tar.gz. This works in any directory! Instead of running these three commands separately, just run the script instead.\nIf you are more inclined to at least try the Terminal experience, so my objective here is complete.\nSome common shell commands:\n\nrm - Remove\nmv - Move\ntouch - Create files\ncat - View file content, or combine files\nls - List files and directories\nfind - Find files based on type, name, or directory\n\nHere are some interesting command line tools to you take a look:\n\nTaskwarrior (Task Management)\nVim or Neovim (Text Editor)\nMariaDB and SQLite (Databases)\nranger (File Manager)\npass (Password Manager)\nFFmpeg (Multimedia Tool)\ncmus (Music Player)\nmpv (Media Player)\nlynx (Browser)\nyt-dlp (Download Youtube Videos, Audio, and Metadata)\n\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/the-only-all-in-one-tool-you-will-ever-need/","title":"The Only All-in-One Tool You Will Ever Need"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/three-years-obsidian-how-it-looks-like/":{"body":"Possibilities are infinite, but many are out of scope. Great Obsidian experience will be much simpler to achieve with these tips!\n\n\nSpecially for new users Obsidian can be challenging to configure and make it truly unique to you, but this only applies for those who want the ultimate note-taking system, which we all know that doesn't exist.\nOver my three years of Obsidian experience, I've used several plugins, templates, themes, and UI configuration. I can absolutely tell that Obsidian is a great tool, but it is too easy to use it in the way it was not intended to. I'm talking about some plugins like: Excalidraw, Kanban, Tasks, Day Planner, Projects, Spaced Repetition, and Dataview.\nObsidian barebones is great enough to give all the necessary tools to level up your note-taking. Can I list all the Obsidian features that make this possible? Sure! Here are them: Bi-directional linking, tagging, properties, bookmarks, outliner, fuzzy finder search, templates, preview edit and vim. That's enough for a minimal experience.\nMy Obsidian was never fully minimalist for a long usage period, but I'm getting more into it, and thus I want to share how to tiny things about Obsidian make it a great tool.\nThe main philosophy in this vault is to keep thing simple, easy to manage, blazingly fast and close to the Obsidian vanilla experience.\nWho is this vault for?\n\nFor beginners that want an overview of what is Obsidian experience like from an experienced user\nFor people who want to focus in writing, and nothing else\nFor those who want to improve their own Obsidian the \"right way\"\nFor those who are considering leaving Obsidian, because it's \"too complex\"\n\nWho is this vault not for?\n\nFor ambitious tinkerers who want to create the perfect Obsidian vault\nFor people who want to combine multiple workflows into Obsidian\nFor people who want to over-scale all sorts of things\n\nUsing it\nThis Obsidian Vault can be found at aocoronel/obsidian-vault\n\nDownload the source code from it, rename the vault (to your liking) and open it in your Obsidian\nClone the repository using git\n\n\nGetting Started\nThis vault is aims to be used with very few plugins, that doesn't add any further than what Obsidian does well as a Markdown Text Editor. I mean: No Task Management, Kanban, Dataview and other big plugins that add breaking changes to Obsidian. These tasks should be solved by other software\nUnderstand the Vault Peculiarities\nVim Text Editor\n\nThis is a text editor widely used for those who appreciate the advanced typing without touching the mouse. The best part of it? It's supported by default!\nThe Relative Line Numbers and Scroll Offset plugins are supposed to be used along with Vim, if you don't want to use it, so you can ignore them\nVim is not a straight away tool. It will require a lot of practice to see its advantages over standard typing. I recommend checking some cheat sheets and videos before trying it\nTo enable Vim go to Editor &gt; Advanced &gt; Vim key bindings\n\nDon't fear the intimidating confirmation popup. Crossing this line, means you leveled up your Obsidian experience\n\n\n\nThe Folder Structure\nIt's a deviated philosophy of keeping no folders, but for good reasons.\nNotes\n\nTo keep all notes truly organized, this is the only folder where notes live\n\nThis enforces a better filename and note tags choice for a better note retrieval\nThis folder also includes fleeting notes\n\nYou can keep aware of your fleeting notes by tagging it as it, and then use queries or search for them\n\n\nThis style makes sure you will never have to deal with file management ever again\n\n\nTo get back to your notes, use the Quick Switcher instead of the built-in file explorer\n\n\nTip, if you need to apply a new convention to your notes, do it as you get to them, and not all at once. It's a very time consuming task if you are not scripting the process.\n\nJournals\n\nThe home for your daily notes (optionally)\nIt's subdivided into three more folders: Daily, Week, and Month (optionally)\n\nI do use Templater, so different note templates are applied to each folder. That's the only reason why it's divided like this\nIf you plan to use it, set the Journal - Week Note as your Week template, else use Journal - Week Note - Vanilla\n\nThe Templater Week Note requires to be created at SUNDAY to it apply correctly\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll be talking more in depth about templates in a further section.\n\nEmbed\n\nThe place for images, videos, audio, and any other file that is not a markdown file\nYou don't need to be aware of it, all files are sent there automatically once added to your vault\nThe reason why it exists, it to allow better image searching only. Image it as if it was a gallery, which you can easily search for you images through a good naming convention\n\n\nI'll be also talking about naming convention in a further section.\n\nTemplates\n\nThis is important for a better template convenience, so the popup will always display templates only, which having to name it Template and search for it\n\nFiles\nFrontmatter\nThis was one of my major challenges over my experience. How to keep the frontmatter powerful, easy to manage and simple? I ended with only four properties.\nAliases\nYou can use aliases in two ways, to set \"quickmarks\" like a specialized bookmark to retrieve a note with few keystrokes, or to allow two names refers to the same note.\nTags\nThis was another of my major challenges. What tags should I use? How to keep thing simple, so tagging is the easiest part of taking notes? The only way I could be aware of all my tags and correctly set them up is by keeping a strict amount of tags available.\nYou may take the advantages of nested tagging: #tag/nested.\nHere are some examples on how you could be tagging your notes in a way it doesn't matter what it is, it just works:\n\nInformation Type\n\n#procedure - Any note that contains a practical step-by-step on how to do something\n#analogy - Relate something you already know to something new\n#concept - A new fact\n#evidence - A fact that complements a concept\n#reference - A fact that doesn't complement a concept\n\n\nBroader Area\n\n#personal\n\n#personal/hobbies\n#personal/feel\n\n\n#work\n\n#work/programming\n#work/medicine\n#work/engineering\n#work/law\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n#source\n\n#source/article\n#source/book\n#source/video\n\n\n\n\nEntity\n\n#people\n\n#people/coworker\n#people/familiar\n#people/friend\n\n\n#place\n#object\n\n\nPriority\n\n#important\n#urgent\n\n\nRelevance\n\n#useful\n\n\nSpecial Tags\n\n#query - Notes that contains Obsidian queries. Allows to query queries, yep\n#index - Notes that contains a collection of other notes to guide you\n\n\n\nSource\nWhenever you take notes from something you found somewhere else, note down where you obtained that information for later usage. You never know when you are gonna need it again!\nBy keeping the original content saved, you can now focus in writing in your own way, the way you understand and would teach it, rather than copy-pasting.\nCSS Classes\nThe used snippets in this vault are from aocoronel/obsidian-snippets, which includes the colorizer and elegantvagrant\n\nimg - This centers all images\njustify - Justify text (disabled by default)\ncolorizer - Changes note colors\n\nAvailable colors are: red green pink red blue yellow orange purple black grey\nYou may use this to visually categorize notes\n\nExample: All notes dedicated to people are green, year notes are red, and so on\n\n\n\n\nelegantvagrant - The dark theme this vault uses\n\nTemplates\nThis vault has currently 23 templates, which you can use and take inspiration from.\n\nInformation Type\n\nTo easily apply information type tags, without having to manually insert it, there are the five tags I mentioned before as templates:\n\nProcedure - Template\nAnalogy - Template\nConcept - Template\nEvidence - Template\nReference - Template\n\n\n\n\nJournal\n\nEach daily note type has their own templates, as I mentioned before, as follows:\n\nJournal - Daily\nJournal - Month\nJournal - Week Note\nJournal - Week Note - Vanilla\n\n\nThe Journal Daily has four sections: Agenda, Journal, Diary, and Review\n\nAgenda - For all your today's tasks you are about to do, or completed\nJournal - What you have been doing throughout the day. Use timestamps\nDiary - Subdivided as:\n\nKey-words - Few words, that defines you whole day\nEmotions - What have you felt during the day?\nGratitude - What are the three things you are grateful for?\n\n\nReview - Your thoughts you had in that day, with some other commented questions to help you reflect\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\nSource - Template\n\nIf your note can include the original work, use it\n\n\nTo easily apply source tags, just like information type templates\n\nSource - Article\nSource - Blog Template\nSource - Book Template\nSource - Video Template\n\n\n\n\nNote types\n\nMinimal - Template\n\nStandard template, if you wish\n\n\nFleeting - Template\n\nFor all your new created ephemeral notes\n\n\nIndex - Template\n\nTags #index for you\n\n\n\n\nOther creative\n\nBlogging - Template\nBook - Template\nPeople - Template\nProject - Template\nProject Proposal Note\n\n\n\nNaming Convention\nNaming files correctly is the core for better retrieval. Here are some tips on how you can set these conventions yourself.\n\nTabs\nThe File Explorer\nAs I mentioned before, all notes are sent to the right folders, except for Template notes. This makes file management useless, thus it is disabled. If you ever need to reach your files, I do recommend using your system explorer instead, and to do so quickly. You can, then, open it pressing Alt + - (minus), and if you want to move a note to another folder use Ctrl + ] (right square bracket).\nOutliner\nFound at the top left sidebar. Press Alt + 1 to quickly show the outliner and use your arrow keys to move across headings in the current files.\nBookmarks\nFound at the top left sidebar. Press Alt + 2 to quickly show it. This feature is fairly more interesting to deal with most frequent notes. Some predefined bookmarks are set.\n\nClean Graph\n\nIt is a bookmarked Graph that hides Journals and Template folders\n\n\nFile Types\n\nContains obsidian queries for different filetypes (PDF, Video, Audio, Image, and Canvas)\n\n\nQuickmarks\n\nJust like I mentioned in the aliases section, but set out from the note\nThe predefined bookmark called T takes you to this file [[Tips]]\n\nPress Ctrl + O (Quick Switcher) and type Tips to access it\nAs Obsidian's Quick Switcher allows fuzzy finder, you don't actually have to rely heavily on this. It's just an idea on how you can use it\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\nFound at the top left sidebar. Press Alt + 3 to quickly move to it.\nSearch\nFound at the top left sidebar. Press Ctrl + Shift + F to quickly move to it.\nBacklinks\nFound at the top right sidebar. Visible all the time. If you plan to use Calendar, I do recommend allocating it above the backlinks.\nSplitting\nThis vault sets the following keybindings to address the splitting workflow, if you wish to use it.\n\nAlt + Shift + [ArrowKeys OR Vim Motion Keys] - Move to different group\nCtrl + Shift + H - Split horizontally\nCtrl + Shift + V - Split vertically\nCtrl + W - Close note or split note\n\nPlugins\nThis vault doesn't have any plugins installed. That's totally in purpose, so you are aware of your own plugin configuration. But I have a list of all the must have plugins.\nIf you are up to using plugins, these fits perfectly into Obsidian vanilla experience, without adding any extra functionality.\nVim Must Have\n\nObsidian Relative Line Numbers\n\nLine numbers are relative to cursor position.\n\n\nScroll Offset\n\nWhen scrolling using hotkeys, the page moves before the cursor reaches the bottom of the screen\n\n\n\nMust Have\n\nCopy Block Link\n\nAllows you to easily copy the block reference or embed reference through your mouse or set hotkey\n\n\nObsidian Footnotes\n\nAllows to easily create footnotes and navigate them using keybindings\n\n\nJournals\n\nSubstitute to the outdated Calendar and Periodic Notes plugins\nHas both calendar and periodic note types (daily, week, month, quarterly, and year note) in a single plugin, plus some extra additions\n\n\nObsidian Linter\n\nPut your markdown into standards, by allowing it to fix all markdown syntax typos for you\n\nAdjust the whole file to keep it looking nice by removing extra lines, ordering footnotes...\n\n\nWhen installing it, you must configure it before using!\n\nConfigure it to properly fix the Linter note, present in this vault\n\n\n\n\nTag Wrangler\n\nTo manage quickly and efficiently tags in bulk\n\n\nTemplater\n\nAutomate boring template usage\nThe Journal Templates use this plugin\n\n\nObsidian Various Complements\n\nGives auto-completion to Obsidian\nAllows to easily type note pages without opening brackets ([[Note]])\nAs your file gets richer in detail, often used words will know display a suggestion to auto-complete it\n\n\nZen Mode\n\nHide all UI\n\n\n\nExtra\n\nImage Converter\n\nAllows you to convert images to compress them\n\nRecommended to set JPG at 75% quality\nAn alternative to JPG is AVIF, which is not supported by Image Converter, but has higher compression results\n\n\nObsidian is not an image converter. You may use an external tool for image compression, like I've done myself\n\naocoronel/converter\naocoronel/__update-image-links.sh\n\n\n\n\nJanitor\n\nLooks for orphan notes and unused embeds, and optionally removes them\n\n\nMulti Properties\n\nSame as Tag Wrangler, but for Properties\n\nProperties don't change often, so it's a once a year plugin\n\n\n\n\nPaste Image Rename\n\nAllows you to rename images when pasting to Obsidian\n\n\n\nDaily Notes\nHave you ever thought about, making daily notes is a waste of time? Maybe, because they grow constantly and you can't review them all. That's why there are week, month, and year based notes, so you can distill only what matters for you from these daily notes. Once you finish your year note, you can now take the gold nuggets from it and add them to your Life note. If you could only choose one note from your whole vault to keep, this should be the one you would keep.\nThat's it!\nThis is all about this vault. Feel free to change it to your personal needs, but remember the philosophy behind this vault. Adding too much complexity will deteriorate your workflow.\nLicense\nThis repository is licensed under the MIT License, a very permissive license that allows you to use, modify, copy, distribute and more.\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/three-years-obsidian-how-it-looks-like/","title":"Three Years of Using Obsidian - Everything into a Vault Template"},"https://aocoronel.github.io/why-i-quit-obsidian/":{"body":"If you think Obsidian can improve your productivity or allow you to learn faster, you got fooled. You don't need anything else than your brain, a piece of paper and a pen.\nIntroduction\nIn January of this year I've posted about my Obsidian template, guiding on how to keep your Obsidian simple and efficient to do what the software really promises. Since then, I've been compressing all the tools I've used to be smaller, and smaller until the point I've realized that I don't even need some of them in the first place.\nLet's recapitulate what my template was all about, and how I've been using it for the last three years.\nThe Minimal Template\n\n\"Obsidian barebones is great enough to give all the necessary tools to level up your note-taking. Can I list all the Obsidian features that make this possible? Sure! Here are them: Bi-directional linking, tagging, properties, bookmarks, outliner, fuzzy finder search, templates, preview edit and vim. That's enough for a minimal experience.\" - Me (2025-01-22)\n\nThe way I used Obsidian the most, was to capture some lectures presentations and create a massive database of information. The more data that I stored there, the most difficult it was to organize and connect things together. Obsidian can trick you by making you think it can allow you to see all things quickly. That's not true, you are totally dependent on yourself to do it. I've had enormous notes with thousands of words, and from time to time I've wasted hours atomizing my notes to be as tinier as possible, therefore more digestible.\nI've used to tag things in a general way, since going all in for specific tags was messing everything, and I've no longer be able to apply meaningful tags that properly describe each note. I've had many templates for different \"types\" of notes, so I could, potentially, save time. I was creating conventions, folder structures, frontmatter styles and conventions to supposedly make my notes more organized. Not forgetting to mention the plugins that enhanced Obsidian to make it more \"usable\".\nThe Shift\nThis workflow translates to hours of typing and writing notes. This is a waste! If all my notes burn, what would I do?\nIn the last year, I started to slowly move towards Mind Mapping. I had some lectures that were simpler, so I've decided to study only using Mind Maps to see how would it affect my performance. The results surprised me. I went very well, without paying so much effort. So, then, I decided to use just it in the last semester. The results, very subjective to me, were excellent. I can pretty much tell you, I've cut my studying time by 90%. A little bit, and I already knew what I've should know, and then I could freely do something else.\nI never thought that I could replace Obsidian, that was supposed to be engineered to improve my productivity, to be beaten up by a piece of paper and a pen. This translated into a very meaningful thing:\n\nTrust in yourself. A tool could never make you more productive or smarter, than your own effort. Essentially, what matters into learning a piece of information efficiently, is the way you think. Dot.\n\nI'm not a professional developer of any kind, but something I see across these professionals, is that they mostly know how to learn, in a way I've never seem before. They would search, read, understand and put their hands in action straight away. And by making part of developing CLI tools, I've started to get this and generally improve my learning capabilities about everything.\nToday\nI don't use Obsidian. I don't use any note-taking tool. When I need to take notes, I usually write everything in a single file, when I'm done I trash it.\nI'm more interested in actually learn something, and learn just what I need instead of consuming books, videos, and any other source of information one upon another. This way I have time to practice, and I do consolidate what I've learned. I shift from a learning modal of learning everything and, then, practicing, to learn just what I need, and possibly learn the other things, once they show up necessary. This saves time, and builds some sort of a reliable foundation.\nI'm aware that what works for me, doesn't work for everyone, and the results may not translate in the same way to you, than it did to me. However, it's just a pleasure for me to share this discovery that, in fact, could improve my productivity.\nConclusion\nI do surely prefer to know something without a digital assistance, to learn things faster, to learn enough instead of everything, rather than rely on a digital tool, keep typing for hours, and poorly understand what I'm studying. I always say that, and I'm gonna say it again: Less is more.\n","id":"https://aocoronel.github.io/why-i-quit-obsidian/","title":"Why I've quit Obsidian"}},"docInfo":{"https://aocoronel.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://aocoronel.github.io/exploring-linux-distros/":{"body":1476,"title":3},"https://aocoronel.github.io/exploring-programming-languages/":{"body":1432,"title":3},"https://aocoronel.github.io/how-to-install-spelling-in-neovim/":{"body":152,"title":3},"https://aocoronel.github.io/how-to-setup-taskwarrior-server-in-2025/":{"body":741,"title":4},"https://aocoronel.github.io/i-dont-use-social-media/":{"body":309,"title":4},"https://aocoronel.github.io/neostow-rewrite-journey/":{"body":1188,"title":3},"https://aocoronel.github.io/nixos-review/":{"body":588,"title":3},"https://aocoronel.github.io/regain-control-over-what-you-watch-in-youtube/":{"body":664,"title":5},"https://aocoronel.github.io/the-only-all-in-one-tool-you-will-ever-need/":{"body":396,"title":3},"https://aocoronel.github.io/three-years-obsidian-how-it-looks-like/":{"body":1383,"title":7},"https://aocoronel.github.io/why-i-quit-obsidian/":{"body":436,"title":3}},"length":12},"lang":"English"}
